# Deep learning in MRI detection of sacroiliac joint inflammation and injury consistent with axial spondyloarthritis

## Prerequisites
We use our own, openly available library `faimed3d` to build and train neural networks on medical data. `faimed3d` can be installed directly from GitHub with `pip install git+github.com/kbressem/faimed3d`. Alternatively one can also clone the repository and create a symbolic link to the `faimed3d` libs.   
This project is implemented using [`nbdev`](https://nbdev.fast.ai/), a true literate programming environment.
